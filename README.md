# 4 Technical Results 

With technical results we can see that the Model fuctions well. It give us a prediction of 82% of changes in the house prices based on the houses characteristcs and a mean squared error about $117,000.00 for train and test data.

#### R^2 final model 
 	0.826

#### Train RMSE
    $ 117,768.73

#### Test RMSE
    $ 117,182.99
